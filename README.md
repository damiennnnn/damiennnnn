# hello world 👋 - damien

### I'm currently working as a Software Engineer for Spectrum @ AVEVA, focused on C# and Azure development.  
***

### I may occasionally tinker or contribute, but don't look too much into my personal projects (they're old and hacky 😄)  
  
But here's a couple of things I've done:
- **Taleria** WIP [Repo](https://github.com/damiennnnn/Taleria)
  - C# Postman-esque API client, with OpenAPI and Azure API Management integration 
- **ProcGen** WIP
  - Perlin noise based procedural generation
